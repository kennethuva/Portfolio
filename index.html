    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I have a background in sales and customer service but it's been a minute since I was in sales. 
        Started in Banking then I went to Retail, then Restaurant Industry, worked as a Receptionist then back to retail.
        Somewhere along the way I realized I would prefer to work from home more and on my own time. 
        I think it's obvious to see the benefits of a career in Programming and that is why I enrolled at Epicodus!
        
        My current Interests are learning Coding, Music and Writing.
        I find space fascinating as well as how the brain works.</p>
